[[request-tracing-configuration]]
= Request Tracing Configuration

As with any other services available in Payara Server, the Request tracing service
can be configured by using the web console, administration commands or editing
the _domain.xml_ configuration file directly.

[[using-the-web-console]]
== Using the Web Administration Console

To configure the Request Tracing Service in the Administration Console, go to
_Configuration -> [instance-configuration (like server-config)] -> Request Tracing_:

image:/images/request-tracing/configuration-admin-console.png[Request Tracing Configuration in the Admin Console]

Check the *Enabled* box (and the *Dynamic* box too if you don't want to
restart the domain) to switch the request tracing service on.

You can configure the request tracing service settings using the following
attributes:

**Threshold Unit**:: This defines the time duration per unit. The accepted options are any
valid
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/TimeUnit.html[java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit]
values. The default value is _SECONDS_.
**Threshold Value**:: This defines the number of units beyond which a request
will be traced.
**Store Historic Traces**:: When present, enables the storage of the slowest
historical request trace events.
**Historic Trace Store Size**:: Determines the number of historical trace events that
can be stored in memory when historical storing is enabled. The default value is
**20** records.
**Historic Trace Store Timeout**:: Determines how long before Request Tracing
messages are removed. This field is specified in the format "%d %h %m %s" where
% is an integer. Any of the units can also be omitted.

Aside from this configuration settings, you can also define which notifiers will be
used to relay the request tracing events by moving them to the **Active Notifiers**
box.

IMPORTANT: Keep in mind that for request tracing events to be relayed to the
active notifiers, both the
link:/documentation/extended-documentation/notification-service/notification-service.adoc[Notification Service]
and each respective notifier must be enabled first.

TIP: You don't need to manually add each notifier on this screen. When enabling
a notifier on its configuration screen, the server will **automatically** add it to the list
of active notifiers for the Request Tracing service. This same result occurs when
enabling the notifier using the appropriate _asadmin_ command.

NOTE: Configuring active notifiers for the Request Tracing service is a feature
available from _Payara Server 4.1.2.172_ onwards.

[[editing-domain-xml-file]]
== Editing the _domain.xml_ configuration file

To configure the Notification Service in the _domain.xml_ configuration
file, locate the `request-tracing-service-configuration` element in the
tree and modify the attributes described in the previous section:

[source, xml]
----
<request-tracing-service-configuration
    enabled="true"
    threshold-value="30"
    threshold-unit="SECONDS"
    historical-trace-store-size="25"
    historical-trace-enabled="true"
    historical-trace-store-timeout="1d 2h 3m 30s">
    <log-notifier></log-notifier>
    <datadog-notifier enabled="true"></datadog-notifier>
    <new-relic-notifier enabled="true"></new-relic-notifier>
    <xmpp-notifier></xmpp-notifier>
    <email-notifier></email-notifier>
    <slack-notifier enabled="true"></slack-notifier>
    <eventbus-notifier></eventbus-notifier>
    <cdi-eventbus-notifier></cdi-eventbus-notifier>
    <hipchat-notifier></hipchat-notifier>
    <snmp-notifier></snmp-notifier>
    <jms-notifier></jms-notifier>
</request-tracing-service-configuration>
----

To activate a notifier for the service, simply change the `enabled` attribute of the
notifier sub-tag (e.g. for the Slack Notifier, use the `slack-notifier` sub-tag
and so forth).

NOTE: If a notifier sub-tag element is not present in the configuration, then that
notifier is treated as inactive when the server starts.

WARNING: Modifying the domain.xml configuration is not a supported configuration
method, so be careful when considering this option.

[[from-the-command-line]]
=== From the Command Line

You can configure the Request Tracing Service by using the administrations commands
documented on the link:asadmin-commands.adoc[corresponding section]

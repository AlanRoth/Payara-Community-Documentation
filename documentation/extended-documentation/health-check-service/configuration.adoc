= HealthCheck Service Configuration

As with any other services available in Payara Server, the HealthCheck service
can be configured by using the web console, administration commands or editing
the _domain.xml_ configuration file directly.

[[using-the-web-console]]
== Using the Web Administration Console

To configure the Request Tracing Service in the Administration Console, go to
_Configuration -> [instance-configuration (like server-config)] -> Healthcheck_:

image:/images/healthcheck/admin-console-configuration.png[HealthCheck Configuration in the Admin Console]

The HealthCheck service configuration is stored in the `domain.xml`. An
example can be seen below:

Check the *Enabled* box (and the *Dynamic* box too if you don't want to
restart the domain) to switch the HealthCheck service on.

The general settings of the service are:

**Threshold Unit**:: This defines the time duration per unit. The accepted options are any
valid
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/TimeUnit.html[java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit]
values. The default value is _SECONDS_.
**Threshold Value**:: This defines the number of units beyond which a request
will be traced.
**Store Historic Traces**:: When present, enables the storage of the slowest
historical request trace events.
**Historic Trace Store Size**:: Determines the number of historical trace events that
can be stored in memory when historical storing is enabled. The default value is
**20** records

Aside from this configuration settings, you can also define which notifiers will be
used to relay the HealthCheck events by moving them to the **Active Notifiers**
box.

IMPORTANT: Keep in mind that for HealthCheck events to be relayed to the
active notifiers, both the
link:/documentation/extended-documentation/notification-service/notification-service.adoc[Notification Service]
and each respective notifier must be enabled first.

TIP: You don't need to manually add each notifier on this screen. When enabling
a notifier on its configuration screen, the server will **automatically** add it to the list
of active notifiers for the HealthCheck service. This same result occurs when
enabling the notifier using the appropriate _asadmin_ command.

NOTE: Configuring active notifiers for the HealthCheck service is a feature
available from _Payara Server 4.1.2.172_ onwards.

[[configuring-the-available-checkers]]
=== Configuring the Available Checkers

Each of the available checkers that are used to determine the server's health can
also be configured separately from each other on the admin console. The list of
the available checkers is as follows:

*CPU Usage*:: Calculates the CPU usage and prints out the percentage along with
the usage time.
*Connection Pool*:: Calculates the ratio of free/used connections available for
all JDBC connections pool an prints the percentage of used connections for each
active pool.
*Heap Memory Usage*:: Calculates the heap memory usage and prints out the percentage
along with initial and committed heap sizes.
*Machine Memory Usage*:: Calculates the machine memory usage and prints
out the percentage along with the total and used physical memory size.
*Hogging Threads*:: Identifies the threads that are hogging the CPU.
*Garbage Collector*:: Calculates and prints out how many times GC is executed with
its elapsed time.

You can configure the settings for each checker on the respective tab in the web
console. Here's a sample image with the current configuration for the *CPU Usage* checker:

image:/images/healthcheck/cpu-usage-checker-configuration.png[CPU Usage Checker Configuration in the Admin Console]

[[common-checker-configuration]]
=== Common Checker Configuration

The following are the configurable attributes available to *ALL* the checkers:

_Enabled_:: Determines whether or not the checker is enabled.
_Dynamic_:: Determine whether the changes done to the checker's configuration are
applied immediately or after the server/instance's restart.
_Name_:: The name or label that the checker will use to identify itself on the
notification events. The default names for all checkers are the following:
+
[cols=",",options="header",]
|====
|Checker |Default name
|*CPU Usage* |`CPUC`
|*Connection Pool* |`CONP`
|*Heap Memory Usage* |`HEAP`
|*Machine Memory Usage* |`MEMM`
|*Hogging Threads* |`HOGT`
|*Garbage Collector* |`GBGC`
|====
_Time_:: The time interval value (as an `Integer`) specified in given unit
to execute the checker for the metric. The default value is **5**.
_Unit_:: This defines the time duration per unit. The accepted options are any
valid
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/TimeUnit.html[java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit]
values. The default value is **MINUTES**.

[[threshold-range-configuration]]
=== Threshold Range Configuration

The following attributes are available to the *CPU Usage*, *Connection Pool*,
*Heap Memory Usage* and *Machine Memory Usage* checkers:

_Threshold Good_:: The upper numeric boundary (valid `Integer`) of the metric used
by the checker for the notification event to be classified as *GOOD*. It has **0**
as default value.
_Threshold Warning_:: The upper numeric boundary (valid `Integer`) of the metric used
by the checker for the notification event to be classified as *WARNING*. It has **50**
as default value.
_Threshold Critical_:: The upper numeric boundary (valid `Integer`) of the metric used
by the checker for the notification event to be classified as *CRITICAL*. It has **80**
as default value.

NOTE: The threshold values range (GOOD - WARNING - CRITICAL) are used to correctly warn users of the health of an specific
metric depending on their value when they are measured based on the checking frequency.
For example, if the *CPU Usage* checker is configured with the default threshold values,
and at measuring time, the CPU is performing at 76,8%. Then this notification event
would be generated:
[source, log]
-----
Health Check notification with severity level: WARNING - CPUC:Health Check Result:[[status=WARNING, message='CPU%: 76.8, Time CPU used: 171 milliseconds'']']
-----

[[special-checkers-configuration]]
=== Special Checkers Configuration

The *Hogging Threads* and the *Garbage Collector* checkers are special on their configuration.
They do not have a threshold range configuration, instead opting for different attributes.

Here's a configuration sample of the *Hogging Threads* checker:

image:/images/healthcheck/hogging-threads-checker-configuration.png[Hogging Threads Checker Configuration in the Admin Console]

The following are the attributes used to configure this checker:

_Threshold Percentage_:: Defines the minimum percentage needed to decide if the
thread is hogged CPU-wise. The percentage is calculated with the ratio of elapsed
CPU time to checker execution interval. Its default value is **95**.
_Retry Count_:: Represents the count value that should be reached by the hogged
thread in order for the service to send notifications. Its default value is **3**

And here's a configuration sample for the **Garbage Collector** checker:

image:/images/healthcheck/garbage-collection-checker-configuration.png[Garbage Collector Checker Configuration in the Admin Console]

As you can see in the image, this checker doesn't have any special configuration
attributes.

[[from-the-command-line]]
=== From the Command Line

You can configure the HealthCheck Service by using the asadmin commands
documented on the link:asadmin-commands.adoc[corresponding section]

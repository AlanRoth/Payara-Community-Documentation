= JMX Notification Configuration

JMX Monitoring can be configured to send notifications using the
link:/documentation/extended-documentation/notification-service/notificationservice.adoc[notification service].
This allows you to forward data from exposed MBeans to your configured
notifiers.

== Configuration

The JMX Monitoring configuration page can be found under *Configurations* ->
`<config-name>` -> *Monitoring*.

image:/images/jmx-monitoring-service/monitoring-page.png[4.1.2.173 Monitoring Page]

From the `Monitoring` page, select the tab labelled `JMX`:

image:/images/jmx-monitoring-service/jmx-monitoring-page-full.png[4.1.2.173 Full JMX Monitoring Page]

The JMX page allows you to specify the time between notifications, how
notifications will be delivered, and the MBeans which will be included within
the message.

== Enabling JMX Monitoring

By default, both JMX and AMX start disabled.

To enable JMX Monitoring for the JVM, select `Enabled`. To also access extra
data from Payara Server via AMX (recommended), select `AMX Enabled`:

Finally, to save your changes, click `Save`.

== Configuring JMX Monitoring Time

To configure the frequency of logged data, enter both the intended frequency
of logs and the unit of time.

For example, to log every 10 milliseconds:

== Selecting notifiers

Before you receive notifications from your chosen notifier, please ensure
that you have configured the
link:/documentation/extended-documentation/notification-service/notification-service.adoc[notification service].

To select notifiers to use for JMX Monitoring, hold the `CTRL` or `SHIFT` key
to select multiple notifiers, and then click `Add >`.

== Adding properties

By default, JMX will output an empty message as there are no MBeans configured.

To add an MBean to the monitoring service, click `Add Property` on the
`Additional Properties` table at the bottom of the page:

image:/images/jmx-monitoring-service/jmx-add-property.png[4.1.2.173 Add JMX Property]

You can now add your monitoring attributes to the notification service using
the following values:

* _name_: the MBean attribute name
* _value_: the MBean domain name
* _description_: displayed in the `get-monitoring-configuration` asadmin
command, _optional_

For example, to monitor the `activeworkcount` of the MBean on the DAS with a
domain of `amx:pp=/mon/server-mon[server],type=connector-service-mon,name=jms-service/work-management`,
you would enter:

image:/images/jmx-monitoring-service/jmx-add-MBean.png[4.1.2.173 Add MBean]

Click the `Save` button at the top of the page to save and exit. If you have
entered all values correctly, you should see a message via your chosen notifier
 with the MBeans contents:

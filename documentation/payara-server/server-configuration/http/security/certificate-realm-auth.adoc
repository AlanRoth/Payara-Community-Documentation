= Certificate Realm Context Configuration

_Since version 5.192_

Payara Server now includes a feature to allow support for using only the value of 
CN from a client certificate for authentication on a secure webapp.
A new flag `common-name-as-principal-name` can be set on the certificate realm to
enable this feature - it is set to false by default.

== Enabling Common Name As Principal Name

This feature can be enabled as follows:

. Navigate to `server-config` under the `Configurations` tab in the tree
. Open `Security/Realms` and select `Certificate`
. Click the `Add Property` button
. Set the new property _Name_ to be `common-name-as-principal-name` and set the _Value_ to `true`

After this, make sure you **restart the server instance** to ensure the changes take effect.

It is now possible to set the value of '<principal-name>' in the glassfish/payara-web.xml
to be just the value of CN - rather than the full certificate string, as shown below:

To disable this option, follow the above steps but set _Value_ to `false` and **restart the server**.

== Using an `asadmin` command

You can also use the following command to set the flag through asadmin:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set configs.config.server-config.security-service.auth-realm.certificate.property.common-name-as-principal-name=true
asadmin> restart-domain $DOMAIN_NAME
----

= Protocols

A protocol is used by a network listener to determine the nature of the communication
expected by the listener. For example, a protocol determines the timeout of a request,
as well as whether HTTPS should be used. The reason the protocol is separate to the
listener is so that the same protocol configuration can be used to listen on multiple
ports.

# Network Listeners

A network listener is a listen socket that has an IP address, port number, protocol,
as well as various other configuration options. A listener can listen on a specific
port on all network interfaces by using the IP `0.0.0.0`, and a configured port.
A virtual server will then be used to select a combination of network listeners to
use for an application. For example, Payara Server has two default network listeners
for user deployed applications: an insecure listener on port 8080 (`http-listener-1`),
and a secure listener on port 8181 (`http-listener-2`).

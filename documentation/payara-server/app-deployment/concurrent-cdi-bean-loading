= Concurrent CDI Bean Loading

_Since Payara Server 5.184_

It is now possible to concurrently load CDI beans to potentially speed up an application's
load time. By default this feature is disabled for all applications on Payara Server, and
enabled for all applications on Payara Micro.

== Enable Concurrent CDI Bean Loading

Concurrent CDI bean loading is configured on a per-config basis using the `set` command:

[source, bash]
----
asadmin set configs.config.server-config.cdi-service.enable-concurrent-deployment=true
----

You can also configure the number of pre-loader threads like so:

[source, bash]
----
asadmin set configs.config.server-config.cdi-service.pre-loader-thread-pool-size=4
----

NOTE: Concurrent deployment of CDI Beans is enabled by default with two preloader
threads in Payara Micro.

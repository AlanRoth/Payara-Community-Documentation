= Daily Log Rotation

_Since version 5.184_

Payara has a easy to use daily rotation setting in the admin console that will rotate server logs every day at midnight, checking 'Rotation on Date Change' will enable this.

By default a size rotation of 2mb is used for logs in Payara Server, meaning no log files will be deleted until the size limit is reached and a new log is made at midnight.

Payara Server also has a number of rotation conditions which can be changed.

* Time - Daily, weekly, monthly or even hourly log rotation.
* Size - Logs are rotated when they exceed a certain limit.
* Number - Logs are rotated when a maximum number of logs is reached.

Which allows you to change how the logs are rotated to your needs or can be combined with daily log rotation. Enabling daily log rotation and setting a limit on the number of logs to keep will keep a certain number of days of logs before old log files get deleted.

= Daily Log Rotation

Payara has a easy to use daily rotation setting in the admin console that will rotate server logs every day at midnight, checking 'Rotation on Date Change' will enable this.

By default a size rotation of 2mb is used for logs in Payara Server, meaning no log files will be deleted until the size limit is reached and a new log is made at midnight.

Payara Server also has a number of rotation conditions which can be changed in the admin console.

* Time - Daily, weekly, monthly or even hourly log rotation.
* Size - Logs are rotated when they exceed a certain limit.
* Number - Maximum number of enteries in a log file.

Which allows you to change how the logs are rotated to your needs or can be combined with daily log rotation. Enabling daily log rotation and setting a limit on the number of logs to keep will keep a certain number of days of logs before old log files get deleted.

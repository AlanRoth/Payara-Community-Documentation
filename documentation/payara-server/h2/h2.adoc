= H2 Database

H2 similar to Derby is a Java based Database. H2 will be included in Payara 5 
by default. Derby will be still included with Payara, but H2 will replace it as 
the default Database. 

== Why replace Derby
In terms of performance Derby is one of the slowest embedded database than 
compare to H2, PostgresSQL, HSQLDB. Another reason for replacing it is H2 also 
has small disk footprint, size of the jar file is around 1.5 MB.

=== To Start the Database

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> start-database
----

Above command will start H2 on the default port, which is 1527. To explicitly 
start Derby run the command below:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> start-database --dbtype derby
----

=== To Stop the Database

To stop the database run the command below:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> stop-database
----

Above command will stop H2 by default. To explicitly stop Derby run the command below:

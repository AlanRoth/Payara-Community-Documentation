= H2 Database

H2 is a Java based Database which will replace Derby as the default database 
in Payara 5. Derby will be still included with Payara 5 but will no 
longer be the default database.

== Why replace Derby
In terms of performance, Derby is one of the slowest  embedded databases as  
compared to H2, PostgresSQL, HSQLDB. H2 also has a smaller disk footprint; the 
size of a jar file is around 1.5 MB.

=== To Start the Database
To start the database run the command below:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> start-database
----

Above command will start H2 on the default port, which is 9092. To explicitly 
start Derby run the command below:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> start-database --dbtype derby
----

=== To Stop the Database
To stop the database run the command below:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> stop-database
----

Above command will stop H2 by default. To explicitly stop Derby run the command below:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> stop-database --dbtype derby
----

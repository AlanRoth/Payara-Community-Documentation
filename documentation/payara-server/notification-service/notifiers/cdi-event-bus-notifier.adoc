`Enabled`::
Enables/Disables the CDI Event Bus notifier.
`Dynamic`::
Starts or Stops the Notificatier in Payara if required.
`Loop Back`::
Enables/Disables whether message should also fire on the same instance or not

Make sure that the "Enabled" box is ticked so that the notifier will be used. If you would like the changes to take effect without needing a restart, tick the "Dynamic" box as well. If you want to receive the message events on the same instance, tick the "Loop Back" box as well.

It would receive structured JSON format data from different events.

To make these changes via the asadmin tool, use the following command, which mirrors the above screenshot:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> notification-eventbus-configure --topicName=my-topic --dynamic=true --enabled=true
----

To check the current applied configuration from asadmin, run the command:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> get-eventbus-notifier-configuration
----

This will return the current configuration, with whether it is currently enabled and the name of the destination topic:

[source, shell]
----
$ asadmin get-eventbus-notifier-configuration
Enabled  Topic Name  
true     my-topic
----

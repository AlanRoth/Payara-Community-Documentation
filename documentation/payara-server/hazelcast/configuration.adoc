[[configuring-hazelcast]]
= Configuring the Domain Data Grid underlying Hazelcast

Payara Server supports configuring Hazelcast through the Admin Console and
asadmin commands. The Hazelcast configuration file can also be directly edited,
but will not be covered in  depth in this section.

Configuration of Hazelcast is set in two sections. The first section applies to the whole
domain and the second section applies to specific configurations and therefore to
Payara Server instances that use that configuration.

Using a Hazelcast configuration file will cause the settings set via the Admin
Console and _asadmin_ commands to be ignored. Any parameters not specified in
the configuration file reverting to the Hazelcast defaults, even if they are
specified in the Admin Console or _domain.xml_ (Note - the
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/resources/hazelcast-default.xml[Hazelcast defaults]
are not necessarily the same as the Payara Hazelcast defaults).

NOTE: Since 4.1.2.172 Payara Server uses its
https://github.com/payara/Payara/blob/master/nucleus/payara-modules/hazelcast-bootstrap/src/main/java/fish/payara/nucleus/hazelcast/PayaraHazelcastSerializer.java[own serializer]
instead of the default Hazelcast one. Setting a global serializer will not override it.
This was created to avoid a https://github.com/payara/Payara/issues/759[bug]
that causes `ClassNotFoundException` errors.

[[setting-hazelcast-configuration-file-admin-console]]
== Setting a Hazelcast Configuration File with the Admin Console

To set the Hazelcast configuration from a Hazelcast Configuration file:

. Select the domain Data Grid configuration from the page tree and click the
*Configuration* tab to view the _"Hazelcast Configuration"_ page:

. On the _Hazelcast Configuration_ page, add the path to your Hazelcast
Configuration file and click "Save". This path is relative to your domain
configuration directory:

[[setting-hazelcast-configuration-file-asadmin]]
== Setting a Hazelcast Configuration File using asadmin

The `set-hazelcast-configuration` command can be used to set the configuration
file:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-hazelcast-configuration --hazelcastconfigurationfile /path/to/file
----

As with the admin console, this path is relative to your domain configuration
directory.

[[configuring-domain-wide-hazelcast-with-the-admin-console]]
=== Configuring Domain Wide Hazelcast Settings with the Admin Console
Some Hazelcast configuration settings apply to the whole domain.
Navigate to the _Data Grid page for the domain wide settings.

image::/images/hazelcast/hazelcast-admin-console-domain-hazelcast-options.png[Data Grid Domain Wide Options]

The following configuration options are available here:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|====
|Property |Description
|Restart Data Grid |Determines if the Hazelcast member embedded in Payara will be
restarted to apply any changes made

|DAS Bind Address|Explicity specifies the IP Address the DAS should bind the Hazelcast instance to.
By default Hazelcast will try to choose the correct bind address from the IP addresses available
on the host. If you find the DAS is binding to an incorrect IP Address the correct address
can be specified here.

|DAS Public Address|This is the public IP Address that the DAS should use if the DAS is
behing a NAT firewall and other Payara Server Instances need to connect via the public
NAT address rather than the internal IP Address

|Auto Increment Port| By default the cluster uses the next unoccupied port that is available starting with the start port. When auto-increment is turned off an occupied start port results in a startup failure instead.

|DAS Start Port | The port the DAS uses to run Hazelcast on. If this port is busy, the port
specified will be incremented until a valid port is found.

|Network Interfaces | Similar to DAS Bind address by default Hazelcast will choose the correct
IP Address to bind to. If you find Hazelcast is binding to the incorrect address a comma separated
list of IP Addresses can be specified here.

|Override Configuration File |Specifies the Hazelcast configuration file
to use. The path specified is relative to the domain _config_ directory.

If you are using a custom GlassFish server configuration for a cluster
or standalone instance (e.g. _cluster-config_), then the Hazelcast
configuration file should be placed in the directory with the same name
(e.g. _<domain-root>/config/cluster-config_). This will ensure it is
replicated to the node during startup.

Using this option to point to a valid Hazelcast configuration file will cause
all other options set to be ignored. Any options unset within the Hazelcast
configuration file will be set to the Hazelcast defaults.

|Data Grid Group Name | Specifies the Hazelcast group name, to be optionally used
 to help divide clusters into logical, segregated groups (i.e. _dev-group_,
   _prod-group_).

|Data Grid Group Password |Specifies the password used to access the Hazelcast
group.

|Start Port|The port the other Payara Server instances use to run Hazelcast on. If this port is busy, the port
specified will be incremented until a valid port is found.

|License Key |Enables
https://hazelcast.com/products/enterprise/[Hazelcast Enterprise]
features.

|Host Aware Partitioning |Whether or not to enable
http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#grouping-types[host-aware partitioning]
 for the cluster.
Host aware partitioning *must be* enabled
on all members of the cluster (including Payara Micro instances) for
this feature to work correctly. This is default in Payara Server 5.181 onwards for both
Payara Server domains and Payara Micro instances.

=== Configuring Server Config Specfic Hazelcast Settings with the Admin Console

Navigate to the _Data Grid_ page for the specific configuration.

The following configuration options are available here:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|====
|Property |Description

|Enabled | See link:enable-hazelcast.adoc[Disabling Data Grid] for detailed information

|Restart Data Grid |Determines if the Hazelcast member embedded in Payara will be
restarted to apply any changes made

|Lite Data Grid Instance|If set to true, cluster members with this configuration
will be Hazelcast "lite" nodes, meaning they will not store any cache data
locally and rely on other cluster members to store data.
|Public Address for this Data Grid Node|The Public Address to use for this Data Grid Node. Used when the node is behind a NAT

|Instance Group | Instance group name for all Server Instances using the configuration.
Future functionality may use this name.

|Hazelcast Instance JNDI Name |The JNDI name to bind the Hazelcast instance to.
|JCache Manager JNDI Name| The JNDI name to bind the JCache Cache Manager to.
|JCache Caching Provider JNDI Name|The JNDI name to bind the JCache Caching Provider to.

|Executor Pool Size| The threadpool size for the Hazelcast Executor service
|Executor Queue Capacity | Queue Capacity of the Data Grid Executor Service. Executions are queued until a thread is available
|Scheduled Executor Pool Size| The threadpool size for the Hazelcast Scheduled Executor service
|Scheduled Executor Queue Capacity | Queue Capacity of the Data Grid Scheduled Executor Service. Executions are queued until a thread is available
|====

Enter your required values, and click _Save_. Restarting the domain or
instance/cluster is not necessary for any changes made to take effect, provided
that _"Dynamic"_ remains set to "_true_"

[[configuring-hazelcast-using-asadmin]]
== Configuring Hazelcast using Asadmin

As noted in the enable Hazelcast section, the `set-hazelcast-configuration`
asadmin command is used to both enable/disable Hazelcast, and to
configure it. The `set-hazelcast-configuration` command is used to set both domain wide
and config specific settings. You can pass the ``--help` option to the command to see
usage instructions and available arguments in your terminal, both of which
are listed below:

# Clustering with Payara Server

Payara Micro can cluster with Payara Server and share web session and JCache data. To cluster with Payara Server, just start a Payara Micro instance with the same Hazelcast cluster configuration as configured in your Payara Server (e.g. multicast address, multicast port, cluster name, and cluster password).

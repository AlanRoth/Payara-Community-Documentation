Running asadmin commands using Preboot and Postboot Scripts
----------------------------------------------------------

Starting from Payara Micro 4.1.1.171, asadmin commands can also be run against a Payara Micro instance at specific moments in its lifecycle. It's possible to run administration commands *before* and *after* the server has started. To do this, you must provide the commands you wish to execute in special scripts.

Structure of a Boot Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Boot scripts are simple text files that contain the _asadmin_ subcommands used to configure the instance. These scripts will follow the next set of rules:

1.  Each _asadmin_ command must be represented in one line of text in the script. No line breaks are allowed.
2.  Each _asadmin_ command must be formatted on the syntax `subcommand [options] [operands]`, as if you were running the commands in a multimode session from the command line.
3.  Empty lines and comment lines (starting with the `#` character) are ignored.

Here's a sample of a post boot script used to configure an instance for production uses:

----
#Disable dynamic reloading of applications
set configs.config.server-config.admin-service.das-config.dynamic-reload-enabled=false
#Disable auto deployment
set configs.config.server-config.admin-service.das-config.autodeploy-enabled=false

#Optimizing Heap size
delete-jvm-options -client:-Xmx1024:-Xms512
create-jvm-options -server:-Xmx2048:-Xms2048

#Configuring Hazelcast cluster
set-hazelcast-configuration --clusterName=my-production-cluster --target=server-config

Configuring Boot Scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When running a Payara Micro from the command line, use the `--prebootcommandfile` and `--postbootcommandfile` options to specify the script file locations like this:

----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --prebootcommandfile prepare-resources.txt --postbootcommandfile ready-production-use.txt
----

When creating an Uber JAR using the `--outputUberJAR` option, the scripts are transferred inside the `MICRO-INF/` directory of the resulting JAR artifact as the `pre-boot-commands.txt` and `post-boot-commands.txt files`. For example, when generating the Uber JAR like this:

----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --prebootcommandfile prepare-resources.txt --postbootcommandfile ready-production-use.txt --outputUberJar custom-micro.jar
----

Examining the JAR structure will confirm that the scripts have been transferred correctly:

Restrictions on Preboot Scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Keep in mind when writing a *preboot* command script, that the commands prepared will be running before the server has booted, which means not all available asadmin subcommands will yield results (for example deploying or listing applications).

It's recommended to create preboot scripts that use simple set commands to change the configuration of existing resources (adding new resouces might not work on all cases) like network listeners, standard domain configuration and such.

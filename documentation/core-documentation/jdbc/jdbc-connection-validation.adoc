JDBC Connection Validation Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From Payara 4.1.1.171 the validators `table` and `custom-validation` now
take the connection pool's _Statement Timeout_ into account. Previously
the lack of timeouts would lead to validators endlessly waiting for a
response.

For details on the new capabilities of Payara Server connection pools,
see the
link:/documentation/extended-documentation/advanced-jdbc/advanced-jdbc-configuration-and-diagnostics.adoc[Advanced
JDBC Configuration and Diagnostics page] in the extended documentation.

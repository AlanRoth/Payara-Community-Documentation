= Password Aliases

By default, passwords within Payara Server are treated like any other property
and are stored in plaintext.

Passwords stored in plaintext can be a security risk - though in some situations
 they are obfuscated, it is still not a guarantee of security.

A password alias allows you to have a plaintext reference to an encrypted
password stored on the server, with the alias being entered wherever the
password was previously.

=== Using a password alias within the Admin Console

To use a password alias, navigate to any setting where you would previously
have entered a password in plaintext:

In place of the previous password, enter `${alias=<password-alias-name>}`:

=== Using a password alias within asadmin commands

In commands where you would have previously entered a password, instead enter
`${alias=<example-alias-name>}`.

*Example:*

----
asadmin> create-jdbc-connection-pool [...] --property password=${alias=<example-alias-name} [...]
----

= Using Password Aliases

By default, passwords within Payara Server are treated like any other property
and are stored in plaintext.

Passwords stored in plaintext can be a security risk - though in some situations
 they are obfuscated, it is still not a guarantee.

A password alias allows you to have a plaintext reference to an encrypted
password stored on the server, with the alias being entered wherever the
password was previously.

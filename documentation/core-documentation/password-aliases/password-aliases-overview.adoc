= Password Aliases

By default, passwords within Payara Server are treated like any other property
and are stored in plaintext. Passwords stored in plaintext can be a security
risk, as you can directly read them, unencrypted and unobstructed.

A password alias allows you to have a plaintext reference to an encrypted
password stored on the server, with the alias being entered wherever the
password was previously.

=== Using a password alias within the Admin Console

To create a password alias using the Admin Console

To use a password alias, navigate to any setting where you would previously
have entered a password in plaintext:

In place of the previous password, enter `${alias=<password-alias-name>}`.

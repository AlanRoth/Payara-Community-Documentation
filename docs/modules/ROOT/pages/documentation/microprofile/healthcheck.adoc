= Eclipse MicroProfile Health Check API

_Since Payara Server 4.1.2.181 and 5.181_

Provided version of the API: {mpHealthSpecUrl}[MicroProfile Health Check {mpHealthVersion}]

[[background]]
== Background

The Health Check API was created to allow easier probing of the state of  computing nodes with a cloud infrastructure environment.

A full overview for the reasoning behind the API can be found in
https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-health/blob/master/README.adoc[the README for the source code repository.]

{mpHealthSpecUrl}[The complete specification] is maintained in the same repository.

[[rest-endpoint]]
== REST Endpoint

The MicroProfile Healthchecks API defines that a REST endpoint are available from the root context at `/health` by default, and that upon invocation all registered health checks are performed and the results aggregated.

This endpoint can be altered using the `set-microprofile-healthcheck-configuration` asadmin command to prevent collisions with other HTTP endpoints that might need to use the `health` context root.
   
NOTE: This endpoint will not be available until at least one application has been deployed.

[[health-check-configuration]]
== Health Check Configuration

Health Check can be configured by using Admin Console or Asadmin commands. 

_Since *5.183*&nbsp;_

[[using-the-admin-console]]
=== Using the Admin Console

To configure the Health Check in the Admin Console, go to Configuration 
→ [instance-configuration (like server-config)] → MicroProfile → Health Check:

= Nodes Scaling Groups Extension

This AutoScale extension can be used to scale a Deployment Group up and down across preconfigured
SSH nodes.

== Installation

Installation is done by dropping modules into the `${GLASSFISH_HOME}/modules` directory of your Payara Server
installation. Ensure that you have the three core modules installed, and then download and install the
following two modules.

== Nodes Scaling Group Configuration

A nodes scaling group can be configured either via the command line or the Admin Console.

### Command Line
The `set-nodes-scaling-group-configuration` command accepts the following parameters:

* `--deploymentgroup` - The Deployment Group tha the scaling group should be attached to. A Deployment Group cannot
have more than one Scaling Group attached to it, and a Scaling Group must be attached to a Deployment Group.
* `--config` - The config that instances created via the `scale-up` command will use.
* `--nodes` - The nodes that the scaling group will add or remove instances to. All nodes must be SSH nodes,
though it will also accept the default node used by the DAS (typically _localhost-domain1_).

The primary parameter of the command is the name of the scaling group you wish to configure.

`set-nodes-scaling-group-configuration --deploymentgroup group1 --config group1-config --nodes "localhost-domain1,node1,node2" scale1`

### Admin Console

From _Deployment Groups_, select the deployment group that you wish to add a nodes scaling group for
and click on the _AutoScale_ tab. This will display the active AutoScale group for the deployment
group (currently none).

From here, click on _Nodes AutoScale Groups_, to view the current configured nodes scaling groups.

[[Usage]]
== Usage

### Creating a Nodes Scaling Group
Creating a scaling group can be done via admin commands or from the admin console.

#### Prerequisites
* Each nodes scaling group must be attached to a deployment group, and said deployment group must not have
any other scaling group attached to it.
* Each nodes scaling group requires a config which isn't the default or server config.
* Each nodes scaling group requires at least one SSH node (the default DAS node can also be used)
* Each nodes scaling group must have a unique name

#### Admin Command

`create-nodes-scaling-group --deploymentgroup group1 --config group1-config --nodes "localhost-domain1,node1,node2" nodes-scaler-1`

#### Admin Console

From _Deployment Groups_, select the deployment group that you wish to add a nodes scaling group for
and click on the _AutoScale_ tab. This will display the active AutoScale group for the deployment
 group (currently none).

From here, click on _Nodes AutoScale Groups_, to view the current configured nodes scaling groups.

Click on the _New_ button, and enter your desired details before hitting _OK_.

### Scaling Up
A Nodes Scaling Group attempts to balance the instances across the configured nodes, but currently takes no
other criteria for determining where the instances should be created.

Scaling is by default limited to between 1 and 100 instances per command. The upper limit can be changed by specifying
the `fish.payara.autoscale.maxscale` system property in the _server-config_.

#### Admin Command
The `scale-up` command accepts a `--quantity` parameter, and is executed against your chosen
_Deployment Group_ (*not* the scaling group).

`scale-up --quantity 3 group1`

#### Admin Console

From _Deployment Groups_, select the deployment group that you wish to scale and click on the _AutoScale_ tab.
This will display the active AutoScale group for the deployment group.

Enter a quantity for how much you'd like to scale the deployment group up by, and click the _Scale Up_ button.

### Scaling Down
A Nodes Scaling Group attempts to balance the instances across the configured nodes, but currently takes no
other criteria for determining which instances should be stopped and removed.

Scaling is by default limited to between 1 and 100 instances per command. The upper limit can be changed by specifying
the `fish.payara.autoscale.maxscale` system property in the _server-config_.

#### Admin Command
The `scale-down` command accepts a `--quantity` parameter, and is executed against your chosen
_Deployment Group_ (*not* the scaling group).

`scale-down --quantity 3 group1`

#### Admin Console

From _Deployment Groups_, select the deployment group that you wish to scale and click on the _AutoScale_ tab.
This will display the active AutoScale group for the deployment group.

Enter a quantity for how much you'd like to scale the deployment group down by, and click the _Scale Down_ button.
